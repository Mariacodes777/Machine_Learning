# Machine_Learning

This repository will feature various ML notebooks in python and R. The first one I will add here is an ML notebook in python on the Titanic dataset. I want to point out I have other ML examples in my Heart_Failure_FP repository as well as some in my Curriculum_Supplemental_ Examples. Hope you enjoy!
