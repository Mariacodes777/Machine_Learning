# Machine_Learning

This repository will feature various ML notebooks. There is one on the Titanic dataset as well as one on a Heart dataset. I want to point out I have other ML examples in my Heart_Failure_FP repository which I did for my final project in my Data Science program, as well as some in my Curriculum_Supplemental_ Examples that I have created for my position as a Data Science Mentor for my students to reference. I also want to note that I know the Titanic dataset has been used a million times, but I used it because it was something I enjoyed in school, as well as it is familiar to mostly everyone:) The heart dataset is less known so I hope you enjoy that notebook as well!
